# Gesture‚ÄØDrawing Application

A voice‚Äë and gesture‚Äëcontrolled drawing program that turns your webcam into a *brush*.
It combines **MediaPipe** hand‚Äëtracking, **OpenCV** video capture, **SpeechRecognition** for
voice commands, and a **Tkinter** canvas for rendering.

## ‚ú® Features

* Draw with 7 different brushes (solid, air, texture, calligraphy, blending, shining, eraser)
* Voice commands for starting/stopping, changing colours, switching brushes, and drawing
  squares/circles
* Mini *‚Äúguess what I‚Äôm drawing‚Äù* game

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/your‚Äëuser/drawing‚Äëapp.git
$ cd drawing‚Äëapp

# 2. Install Python dependencies
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Fill out the config.py file with an API KEY from https://groq.com/ 

### 4. To start remote:
  The host has to run python gesture_drawing/server.py to start the server.
  In the config.py file 
  * the host has to set ` IP4_ADDRESS_OF_SERVER_HOST = "localhost"` `
  * the client has to set it to the ip4 adress of the host. This adress is found by running: **$ ipconfig getifaddr en0** (en0 for WIFI, en1 for LAN) on the host computer (For MacOS). `IP4_ADDRESS_OF_SERVER_HOST = <HOST-IP> `

  after running both programs it should sync as long as they are in the same network (WIFI).

## üöÄ Running the App

```bash
# Run without LLM
python -m gesture_drawing

# Run with LLM (API KEY needed)
python -m gesture_drawing --llm

```

Make sure **one** webcam is connected; the first camera in the device list is used.
